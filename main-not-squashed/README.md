# Branch: main-not-squashed

This branch represents a main branch where not squashed "development commits" were merged.

## Short explanation

While developing a feature you usually create a lot of "development commits" on your feature branch.
Development commits could be some tryouts of methods, that are reverted in one of the latter commits, ...

Normally only the end result is relevant for the feature, not the steps that were done while developing that.
That means, that all this development commits should be squashed to usually one feature complete commit.

This branch represents the case, where all the development commits are merged to the main branch without to squash them.
